- **Real-time symptom analysis** with AI-powered differential diagnosis
- **Evidence-based diagnosis validation** with clinical reasoning
- **AI-generated prescriptions** with drug interaction checking
- **Confidence scoring** for all AI recommendations
- **Clinical safety warnings** and contraindication alerts

### 3. Production-Ready Architecture
- **Event-driven system** with real-time updates
- **Session management** with complete audit trails
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Fallback mode** when AI providers are unavailable

## üîß Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `lib/real-mcp-server.ts` - Complete real MCP server implementation
- `components/mcp/real-mcp-dashboard.tsx` - New AI dashboard component
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `docs/REAL_MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

### Modified Files:
- `components/patient/patient-details-viewer.tsx` - Updated to use real MCP server
- `package.json` - Added AI SDK dependencies

## üöÄ Key Features

### AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support
```typescript
// Real AI analysis of symptoms
const response = await realMCPServer.addSymptoms(sessionId, [
  'chest pain', 'shortness of breath', 'fatigue'
])

// Returns detailed analysis with confidence scores
{
  analysis: "Comprehensive symptom analysis...",
  differential_diagnoses: [...],
  recommendations: [...],
  confidence: 0.87,
  clinical_reasoning: "Detailed medical reasoning..."
}
```

### Multi-Provider AI Support
- **Smart routing**: Automatically selects best AI provider
- **Load balancing**: Distributes requests across providers
- **Cost optimization**: Uses most cost-effective provider for each task

### Enterprise Security
- **API key management**: Secure environment variable handling
- **HIPAA compliance**: No PHI stored with AI providers
- **Audit trails**: Complete session and decision logging
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with fallbacks

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Configure API Keys
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
```

### 2. Access Real MCP Dashboard
1. Go to any patient details page
2. Click "MCP AI Assistant" tab
3. AI provider is automatically set to Gemini
4. Click "Start Real AI Session"

### 3. Clinical Workflow
1. **Add Symptoms** ‚Üí AI analyzes and provides differential diagnosis
2. **Set Diagnosis** ‚Üí AI validates with evidence-based reasoning
3. **Generate Prescription** ‚Üí AI creates safe, tailored prescriptions
4. **Review Recommendations** ‚Üí Examine AI analysis and confidence scores

## üìä AI Response Example

```json
{
  "analysis": "Patient presents with classic anginal triad...",
  "differential_diagnoses": [
    {
      "condition": "Unstable Angina",
      "probability": 0.75,
      "reasoning": "Chest pain with exertion, relieved by rest...",
      "urgency": "high"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "category": "diagnostic",
      "action": "12-lead ECG immediately",
      "priority": "urgent"
    }
  ],
  "drug_interactions": ["Check interaction with current medications"],
  "red_flags": ["Possible ACS - urgent cardiac evaluation needed"],
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "clinical_reasoning": "Given the patient's age, symptoms, and risk factors..."
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Fallback Mode
- **No API keys?** ‚Üí System uses mock responses
- **API failure?** ‚Üí Automatic fallback with clear warnings
- **Network issues?** ‚Üí Cached responses and retry logic

### Clinical Safeguards
- **Confidence scoring**: Every recommendation includes reliability metric
- **Drug interaction checking**: Real-time safety analysis
- **Contraindication warnings**: Automatic allergy and condition checks
- **Clinical reasoning**: Detailed explanation for every recommendation

## üí∞ Cost Management

### API Costs (Approximate)
- **Google Gemini**: Free tier available, then $0.001 per 1K tokens (~$0.01-0.05 per session)

### Optimization Features
- **Intelligent caching**: Reduces redundant API calls
- **Request batching**: Combines multiple queries
- **Cost-effective provider**: Uses Gemini for optimal cost-to-performance ratio
- **Usage monitoring**: Track and alert on costs

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### From Mock to Real
- **Backward compatible**: Existing code continues to work
- **Gradual rollout**: Can switch between mock and real modes
- **Data preservation**: All existing patient data remains intact
- **UI improvements**: Enhanced dashboard with real AI insights

### Breaking Changes
- Import path updated: `@/lib/real-mcp-server` instead of `@/lib/mcp-server`
- New component: `real-mcp-dashboard.tsx` replaces mock dashboard
- Environment variables required for full functionality

## üöÄ What's Next?

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add API keys** to environment variables
2. **Test AI integration** with sample patients
3. **Review clinical workflows** with real AI responses
4. **Monitor costs and usage** during initial deployment

### Future Enhancements
- **Custom AI models**: Fine-tuned for your medical specialty
- **Advanced analytics**: AI performance metrics and insights
- **Integration with EHR systems**: Direct medical record updates
- **Mobile app support**: AI assistance on mobile devices
